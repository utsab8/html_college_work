# HTML Exercises - Complete Web Development Practice

## Assignment Title
**HTML Fundamentals: Complete Web Page Development with Forms, Tables, and Semantic Elements**

## Brief Description
This project contains a comprehensive HTML webpage that demonstrates various fundamental HTML concepts through four distinct exercises:

1. **Exercise 1: Simple Web Page** - Covers basic HTML elements including headings, paragraphs, lists (ordered and unordered), hyperlinks, and images.

2. **Exercise 2: Building a Form** - Implements a complete HTML form with text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, textarea, and a submit button, all with proper labels.

3. **Exercise 3: HTML Tables** - Creates a structured table with headers, data rows, merged cells (colspan and rowspan), borders, and a descriptive caption.

4. **Exercise 4: HTML Semantic Elements** - Utilizes HTML5 semantic elements including `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to create a well-structured, accessible webpage.

The webpage is fully styled with CSS to enhance readability and visual appeal, making it an excellent learning resource for understanding HTML fundamentals.

## Steps to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)
- No additional software or server required

### Running the Project

1. **Download or Clone the Project**
   - Ensure you have the `index.html` file in your project directory

2. **Open the HTML File**
   - **Option A: Double-click method**
     - Navigate to the project folder
     - Double-click on `index.html`
     - The file will open in your default web browser

   - **Option B: Right-click method**
     - Right-click on `index.html`
     - Select "Open with" and choose your preferred web browser

   - **Option C: Drag and drop**
     - Open your web browser
     - Drag the `index.html` file into the browser window

   - **Option D: Using file path**
     - Open your web browser
     - Press `Ctrl + O` (or `Cmd + O` on Mac)
     - Navigate to the project folder and select `index.html`
     - Click "Open"

3. **View the Webpage**
   - Once opened, you should see the complete webpage with all four exercises
   - Navigate through different sections using the navigation bar
   - Interact with the form elements
   - Observe the table structure and merged cells
   - Review the semantic HTML5 elements

### Testing the Features

1. **Exercise 1 - Basic Elements**
   - Scroll through headings and paragraphs
   - View the ordered and unordered lists
   - Click on the "Visit Google" link to test hyperlinks
   - Verify that the image loads correctly

2. **Exercise 2 - Form**
   - Enter your name in the text field
   - Select a gender option using radio buttons
   - Check multiple hobbies using checkboxes
   - Type comments in the textarea
   - Click the Submit button (form submission will not work as there's no backend server)

3. **Exercise 3 - Table**
   - Observe the table structure with borders
   - Notice the merged cells (colspan and rowspan examples)
   - Read the caption at the top
   - Check the header row with different column titles

4. **Exercise 4 - Semantic Elements**
   - Review the header section at the top
   - Use the navigation bar to jump between sections
   - Read the article content about semantic HTML
   - Check the aside section with additional information
   - View the footer with contact information

## File Structure
```
ram/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file containing all exercises
└── README.md           # This documentation file
```

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - Markup language for structuring content
- **CSS3** - Styling and layout (embedded in HTML)
- **Web Browsers** - For rendering and displaying the webpage

## Browser Compatibility
This project is compatible with all modern web browsers:
- Google Chrome (latest version)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
- Microsoft Edge (latest version)
- Safari (latest version)
- Opera (latest version)

## Notes
- The form in Exercise 2 does not have a backend server, so clicking Submit will not send data anywhere. This is expected behavior for a frontend-only HTML exercise.
- The image in Exercise 1 uses a placeholder service. In a production environment, you would replace this with your own image file.
- All semantic HTML5 elements are properly commented in the code to explain their purpose.
- The CSS styling is embedded in the HTML file using `<style>` tags for simplicity. In larger projects, you would typically use an external CSS file.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should understand:
- Basic HTML document structure
- Different HTML elements and their purposes
- How to create and style forms
- Table creation and cell merging techniques
- The importance and usage of semantic HTML5 elements
- Best practices for organizing HTML content
